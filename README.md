# XeneX AI — Landing (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This is a minimal landing page scaffold for XeneX AI built with Vite, React, Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.

Features:
- Dark, premium aesthetic with glassmorphism and gradients
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Framer Motion for smooth fade/hover animations

Getting started

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd xenexai
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Notes

- Tailwind's CLI is driven via PostCSS. If you see unknown at-rule errors in editors, they are from the editor's CSS linter — build/runtime will work after installing dependencies.
- The project is intentionally minimal; replace artwork, icons, and copy as needed.
